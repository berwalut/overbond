I have made two csv files for sample inputs. I made this choice because data could be large and therefore it is easier to store data in csv format. 'Book1.csv' and 'Book2.csv' are the two csv files that I import in my code. The program can be changed in the future to directly accept input from the user. 

### Instructions

To check the functionality of first challenge -
* Open command line
* Go to the directory where the files are cloned
* Run the command "python challenge1.py" for the first challenge and the command "python challenge2.py" for the second challenge
* To run the tests on these two challenges, Run the command "python -m unittest unit_tests.py".
